# Reiz Tech Internship

Prompts:
1. Please write console app. User should be able to input hours and minutes of the analogue clock. Program must calculate lesser angle in degrees between hours arrow and minutes arrow and provide output in the console window.

2. Imagine we have a hierarchical structure:

After creating this object, we can add new Branch type objects into branches variable. Doing so we increase object depth by one. Into created objects we can add again new branches etc. In the figure below we have similar structure. This structure depth is 5.

Please write a program, where you would create similar structure. Pass this structure into your own created method and calculate the depth of provided structure. Main requirement to complete this task: use recursion.
